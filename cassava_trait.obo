def: "Visual rating of leaf longevity using a scale of 1 =(very poor retention) to 5 = (outstanding leaf retention)." [CO:mb, ISBN:978-131-347-1]
comment: Improved leaf retention has been suggested as a possible means to increase cassava productivity under stressed conditions. Cassava cultivars with high leaf retention have been found to produce more total fresh biomass and higher root dry matter than cultivars without the trait.
